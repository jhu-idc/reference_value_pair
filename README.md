This repo was originally created by: https://git.drupalcode.org/project/reference_value_pair

It is modified slightly to meet our needs here at JHU. 

Specific changes include:
 * the addition of a variant of the Reference Value Field Type called Language Value Pair that pairs a string with a Language Taxonomy Term.  
 * serialization into JSON-LD via a hook in the module code. 
 
Reference Value Pair FieldType is generic and will accomodate a string attached to any entity reference. 
 
The Language Value Pair is more specific and requires that a Language Taxonomy exists.  The Language Taxonomy must have a field in it named field_language_code.  The field_language_code needs to be string that this module can use to put into the JSON-LD for this widget. 

A good TODO would to bring this Language Taxonomy into this module to ensure that it's there.

INTRODUCTION
------------

The Reference value pair module combines an entity reference with a free text
value field in one new field type.

Site builders often end up using field collection or entity reference modules
when all they want to do is store a value and a reference (e.g. to a taxonomy
term).

This module bundles the two things, a reference to some entity and a value
together in one field. It can reference any entity, the value field is a simple
text field.

One typical use is storing a measurement with its unit where the units are
stored in a taxonomy (e.g 50 liter, 20 cm, 80 %).
